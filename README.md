# 🌲 Forest Fire Detection using Machine Learning 🔥

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of forest fires using environmental parameters and machine learning techniques. The model is deployed using Streamlit for easy and interactive access.

## 🚀 Project Features

- Predicts forest fire occurrence based on input features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.
- Built using a supervised learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
- Deployed as a **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.
- User-friendly UI with clear visualization and output display.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Streamlit (for model deployment)

## 📊 Input Features

- `Temperature (°C)`
- `Relative Humidity (%)`
- `Wind Speed (km/h)`
- `Rainfall (mm)`

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Training Techniques:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Feature scaling and selection  
  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimization
